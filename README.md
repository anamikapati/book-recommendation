# 📚 Book Recommendation System
This project demonstrates how to build a basic Book Recommendation System using Python and machine learning techniques in a Jupyter notebook environment.

# 🚀 Features
Recommend books similar to a given title
Uses a dataset of books, authors, and user ratings
Simple content-based filtering approach (or collaborative filtering if used)
Interactive interface via Jupyter Notebook

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 🐍
Pandas 📊
Scikit-learn 🤖
Jupyter Notebook 📒

# 📊 How It Works
Load the dataset
Clean and preprocess the data
Create a similarity matrix (TF-IDF or cosine similarity)
Define a recommendation function
Input a book title → Get top N recommended books

# 💡 Example Output
  Input: "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"
  Recommended:
